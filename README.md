# [Habit Tracker](https://python-web-habit-tracker-9vit.onrender.com)
A web-based habit tracking application that helps users build and maintain positive daily habits through a simple, calendar-based interface.

Users can create personalized habits, mark daily completion, and visually track consistency over time using a calendar view. The application prioritizes clarity and ease of use, focusing on meaningful progress rather than complex analytics or gamification.

This project serves as a functional full-stack demo showcasing frontend UI design and backend development using Python and Flask.
