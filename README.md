# Habit Tracker
This project is a web-based application for tracking habits that aims to assist users in the development and maintenance of positive personal habits. The software offers a simple graphical tool for users to establish personal goals.

This would allow users to reflect on their consistency and change habits by seeing these behaviors play out on a calendar design. The focus for the project would be on making it clear and easy to use, and to track meaningful progress rather than relying on complex analysis or use of gamification techniques.

This repo attempts to be used as an actual functional demo, which, in turn, attempts to be used as a demonstration of one’s skills in frontend and full-stack development.


## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML/CSS
Backend: Python Flask


## Features
With this application, users can:
* Create and manage a personalized list of daily habits
* Mark habits as completed on a day-by-day basis
* Navigate a calendar view to review past activity and completion history


## Running Locally
To run this project locally:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt.
3. Start the Flask application and access it through your browser.


## Future Improvements
* Allow habits to be set for flexible time intervals (e.g., weekly, custom schedules)
* Prevent users from marking habits as completed for past dates
* Add streak tracking and progress summaries
* Improve overall UI/UX and accessibility
