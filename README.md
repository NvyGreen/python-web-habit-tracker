# [Habit Tracker](https://python-web-habit-tracker-9vit.onrender.com)
A web-based habit tracking application that helps users build and maintain positive daily habits through a simple, calendar-based interface.

Users can create personalized habits, mark daily completion, and visually track consistency over time using a calendar view. The application prioritizes clarity and ease of use, focusing on meaningful progress rather than complex analytics or gamification.

This project serves as a functional full-stack demo showcasing frontend UI design and backend development using Python and Flask.


## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML/CSS  
Backend: Python (Flask)  
Database: MongoDB


## Features
With this application, users can:
- Create and manage a personalized list of daily habits
- Mark habits as completed on a day-by-day basis
- View habit consistency and completion history using a calendar-based interface


## Running Locally
To run this project locally:
1. Ensure Python (3.9+) is installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the required dependencies.
4. Configure any required environment variables (if applicable).
5. The application uses MongoDB for data storage (local instance required).
6. Start the Flask development server.
7. Open the application in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
8. You should now be able to create habits, mark daily completion, and view progress in the calendar view.


## Future Improvements
* Allow habits to be set for flexible time intervals (e.g., weekly, custom schedules)
* Prevent users from marking habits as completed for past dates
* Add streak tracking and progress summaries
* Improve overall UI/UX and accessibility
